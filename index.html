          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p>
            This project was made as a semester project at NOROFF School of
            Technology during my first year studying FrontEnd Development.The
            project was made to showcase what we hade learned so far in regards
            to both design and coding. At this point in the program we had not
            learned any JavaScript yet, so the project is build with only HTML
            and CSS.

          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p>
            This Project Exam was made as en Exam at the end of my first year
            studying FrontEnd Development at NOROFF. We where tasked with
            building a blog for whatever we wanted and it had to include a few
            features. It was a challenging but fun project to work on and I
            think I improved a lot o my coding skills. teste teste test test

          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p>
            This project was made as a Cross Course project during my first year
            at NOROFF. The project started out as a simple HTML and CSS only
            project and during the year evolved to a point where you can see
            here. This is where we first started working on API calls and using
            Wordpress Rest API to use WordPress as a headless CMS system.
