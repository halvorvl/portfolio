      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>
        I am 39 year old family father with a wide background in all sorts of
        fields and start-ups. My hole adult life I have been part starting and
        running businesses. I have done everything from starting up and running
        a brewery for for 6 years, starting a bar and a travel company. At one
        point I also run a company responsible for taking street view photos all
        across Europe, and ypu can to this date find thees images online.
      </p>

      <p>
        At one point a realized that no matter what I was working with, I always
        needed to to hire people to help with design and web development and
        alway eager to learn new things I decided it was time to go to school
        for the first time in a very long time. I am now studying FrontEnd
        Development at NOROFF, and absolutely loving it. Over the first year of
        studying I have learnt a lot and I am looking forward to continuing my
        journey.

        keep adding them as they become more.
